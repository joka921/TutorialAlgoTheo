# TutorialAlgoTheo
Slides from Johannes' AlgoTheo tutorial in Winter Semester 18/19 and 19/20

# Disclaimer:
These slides might contain all kinds of errors or inaccuracies that might or might not be corrected in the annotations.
They were originally made to accompany a live tutorial so the information might be incomplete.
One might however still find use in these slides since I sometimes use a slightly different approach or notation
than the official master solution.
